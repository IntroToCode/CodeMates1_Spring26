### Ingredients:

Crepe Batter
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/4 cup tapioca starch (or sweet potato starch)
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 cup water
- 1 tsp neutral oil (plus more for cooking)
- 2–3 scallions, finely sliced

For Cooking
- 4 large eggs
- Neutral oil, as needed for the pan

Sauce (optional but traditional)
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp sweet soy sauce (or soy sauce + sugar)
- 1 tsp rice vinegar (optional)
- Chili sauce or chili oil, to taste

Optional Fillings
- Sliced cheese
- Ham or bacon
- Fresh herbs (e.g., cilantro)

### Steps for preparation:

1. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, tapioca starch, and salt until evenly combined.
2. Add the water and 1 teaspoon of oil to the dry ingredients and whisk until you have a smooth, lump-free batter.
3. Stir in the sliced scallions and let the batter rest for about 5–10 minutes.
4. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and lightly coat it with oil.
5. Pour about 1/4 of the batter into the pan and quickly swirl to form a thin, even crepe. Cook for 1–2 minutes until the bottom is set and lightly golden.
6. Crack one egg directly onto the surface of the crepe and spread it evenly across the top with a spatula.
7. Cook until the egg is mostly set, then carefully flip the entire crepe over so the egg side faces down.
8. Cook for another 1–2 minutes until the egg is fully cooked and lightly golden.
9. If using cheese or other fillings, place them on top of the crepe while it is still in the pan so they warm through.
10. Transfer the crepe to a cutting board and roll it up tightly from one side to the other.
11. Slice the rolled crepe into bite-sized pieces.
12. Mix together the sauce ingredients in a small bowl and drizzle over the sliced dan bing before serving.

### Notes:
- Tapioca or sweet potato starch gives dan bing its signature chewiness. Substituting with cornstarch will change the texture.
- For crispier edges, cook slightly longer before adding the egg.
- Street vendors often press and chop the rolled crepe directly in the pan for extra crisp texture.
- You can make the batter ahead of time and refrigerate it for up to 1 day; stir before using.
